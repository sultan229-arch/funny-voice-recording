### 它是什麼？

Record your voice using the BBC micro:bit’s microphone and play it back speeded up – or slowed down.

### 如何使用它

Put the code below on a micro:bit. Press button A and speak into the microphone. A square appears on the LED display while it’s recording. 

Press button B to play back the recorded sound. It plays back twice as fast, making your voice speed up and sound squeaky!

### 運作方式

The code sets the sample rate to 10,000 Hertz (Hz) for recording. This means the micro:bit measures, or samples, sound from the microphone 10,000 times every second.

When it plays it back, it plays back the samples twice as quickly, 20,000 times every second. This means it plays back twice as fast, and doubles the pitch of any sounds it recorded.

Recording a new sound will delete your previous recording, as will pressing the reset button on the back, or unplugging the micro:bit from its power source (USB or battery pack).
